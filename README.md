# USSF-js-async-checkpoint
This program will take the name of the pokemons and will query the PokeApi and return their corresponding abilities and output it into a text file.


By default, it should be envoked with 2 txt files and the npm start command.
For Example:
npm start pokemon.txt pokemonOutput.txt

Where pokemon.txt is a text file in the same directory you are running the program in and holds the pokemons in separate lines.

pokemonOutput.txt is the name of the file which will be created and will host the output of the program. It does not need to exist, the program will create it.
